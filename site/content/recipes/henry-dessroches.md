    "description": "This recipe entered our holiday traditions when I was about 8. I wish I could say it was passed down for generations â€” but no, my dad found it in a book. In our house, the formal holiday meal was on Christmas Eve, which my dad was in charge of. My mom's not a huge fan of the kitchen, but she's a master at putting Butter Braids in the oven for Christmas breakfast. ðŸ™„"
