    "description": "In our family, there was one dish that got attached to a person — Grandma's stuffing. I don't know where it originally came from. It may have been passed down for generations, or she may have pulled it from a Betty Crocker book in the 60's. Either way, it's important to note that it has sausage — and so it's amazing — and that since she passed everyone in the family competes to see who can make the most authentic version. This version comes from my mom."
