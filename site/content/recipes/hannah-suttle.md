          <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degree C)</li>
          <li>Mix flour, butter, and salt in a bowl or food processor until it has a sandy texture</li>
          <li>Whisk an egg and add it to the mixture</li>
          <li>Add cold water (as needed) until the mixture binds but is not sticky.</li>

          <li>Dust the counter with flour and roll out two-thirds of the pastry until it is about 1/8 of an inch thick</li>
          <li>Use a small pie or circular cookie cutter to cut the dough to fit in a muffin tray</li>
          <li>Place the dough into the tray and fill each of the cups about 2/3 with mincemeat</li>
          <li>Roll out the rest of the pastry and cut to the same thickness but smaller circles to make tops for the pies (you can also cut them into stars or other holiday shapes)</li>
          <li>Line the edges of the tops with water and press them onto the pies</li>
          <li>Poke a small hole or two in the top of each pie</li>
