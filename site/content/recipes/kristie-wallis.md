    "description": "I grew up making these cookies with my mom and grandmother every Christmas. My Nana's Hungarian cookies were her signature dish. As soon as an uncle or another family member received them, others were at her doorstep saying, 'I heard you made some cookies.' 
As my mom says, they're like potato chips. You can't just eat one!"
