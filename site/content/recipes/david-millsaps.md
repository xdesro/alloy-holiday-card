    "description": "In my family, cooking is an art form and an expression of love. We are big on old traditions and local ingredients. Everyone is a decent cook. One of our close friends, who is also an excellent cook, introduced this recipe to me. It stands in stark contrast to those values, but it goes so well with traditional southern holiday dishes and it's easy. A great potluck addition — guests always love it, and my wife is always ashamed to serve it."
