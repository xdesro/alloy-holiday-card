They live in the Midwest and on the years when I do make it out there, my wife and I need a recipe that can be put together in situ and doesn't require a lot of kitchen space or time. This recipe isn't just for holidays, either â€” it can be used for any gathering you're invited to without much warning. As an added bonus, these cupcakes can be made vegan!"
